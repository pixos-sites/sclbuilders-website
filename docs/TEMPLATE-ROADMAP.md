# Template Roadmap

## Family #1: Fixed-Section Service Site

Status: Active

Characteristics:
- One-page service business layout
- Fixed section architecture
- Preset-driven content, colors, and typography
- Build-time preset selection

Current presets:
- Plumber
- Electrician

## Family #2: Alternate Layout/Section Architecture

Status: Planned

Goal:
- Introduce a distinctly different visual and structural system to avoid repetitive output across client sites.

Start Family #2 when one or more of these are true:
- Family #1 presets begin to look too similar for client-facing demos.
- A client needs materially different section order or conversion flow.
- Family #1 component constraints force repeated custom overrides.

Family #2 should change at least:
- Hero/above-the-fold structure
- Core section sequence
- Portfolio/testimonial presentation pattern
- CTA placement model
